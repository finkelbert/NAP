These voiceless fricatives are in any case marginal, regardless of their position as onset cluster-initial consonants or in a simple medial coda. 
Also: Note that Cypriot Greek has the other fricative-stop clusters, not just s-stop!!!!(122c) (122a) (131) (120c) are consonanats also categorical? what's their meaning then (before orthography?)}

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.}

	abstract = {Perceptual systems have finite memory resources and must store incoming signals in compressed formats. To explore whether representations of a sound’s pitch might derive from this need for compression, we compared discrimination of harmonic and inharmonic sounds across delays. In contrast to inharmonic spectra, harmonic spectra can be summarized, and thus compressed, using their fundamental frequency (f0). Participants heard two sounds and judged which was higher. Despite being comparable for sounds presented back-to-back, discrimination was better for harmonic than inharmonic stimuli when sounds were separated in time, implicating memory representations unique to harmonic sounds. Patterns of individual differences (correlations between thresholds in different conditions) indicated that listeners use different representations depending on the time delay between sounds, directly comparing the spectra of temporally adjacent sounds, but transitioning to comparing f0s across delays. The need to store sound in memory appears to determine reliance on f0-based pitch and may explain its importance in music, in which listeners must extract relationships between notes separated in time.}

	abstract = {During speech production, we make vocal tract movements with remarkable precision and speed. Our understanding of how the human brain achieves such proficient control is limited, in part due to the challenge of simultaneously acquiring high-resolution neural recordings and detailed vocal tract measurements. To overcome this challenge, we combined ultrasound and video monitoring of the supralaryngeal articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue) with electrocorticographic recordings from the cortical surface of 4 subjects (3 female, 1 male) to investigate how neural activity in the ventral sensory-motor cortex (vSMC) relates to measured articulator movement kinematics (position, speed, velocity, acceleration) during the production of English vowels. We found that high-gamma activity at many individual vSMC electrodes strongly encoded the kinematics of one or more articulators, but less so for vowel formants and vowel identity. Neural population decoding methods further revealed the structure of kinematic features that distinguish vowels. Encoding of articulator kinematics was sparsely distributed across time and primarily occurred during the time of vowel onset and offset. In contrast, encoding was low during the steady-state portion of the vowel, despite sustained neural activity at some electrodes. Significant representations were found for all kinematic parameters, but speed was the most robust. These findings enabled by direct vocal tract monitoring demonstrate novel insights into the representation of articulatory kinematic parameters encoded in the vSMC during speech production.}

	abstract = {Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak. Multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of different consonant-vowel syllables reveal distinct speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically, with temporal and spatial patterns of activity across the neural population corresponding to phonetic features and dynamics. The act of speaking requires precisely timed coordinated movement of the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx. Edward Chang and colleagues have explored the neural basis of this precise motor control. Multi-electrode recordings in human sensorimotor cortex reveal that the region of the brain involved in speech is laid out according to a somatotopic representation of the face and vocal tract, with large populations of cells corresponding to specific phonetic features. Of particular interest is an additional laryngeal representation located at the dorsal-most end of the ventral sensorimotor cortex, apparently absent in non-human primates, that may be a feature developed uniquely for the specialized control of speech.}

It fits with Wedel's models. Earlier, and more frequent (type- and token-wise) distinctions may be encoded with more strength(14) There's a basic idea of Gestalt. Things that matter more (distinctions that play a role in perception) are encoded while others are ignaored. Earlier encodings are stronger and more robust.(12) (19)}

Morpheme internally, these clusters are subject to a homorganicity constraint in English, which would be represented in a conventional phonology by a feature spreading rule. Yet such a rule does not do justice to the lexical statistics. The strength of the homorganicity requirement depends on the manner of the obstruent and the place of articulation of both the nasal and the obstruent. Some NO clusters are therefore extremely frequent (e.g. /nt/), others are unattested (/m7/) , and yet others fall between these two extremes (/nf/). Because NO clusters are a phonetically coherent set, and sample the range of frequencies finely, they make Hay, Pierrehumbert and Beckman}

	abstract = {Speech recognition is remarkably robust to the listening background, even when the energy of background sounds strongly overlaps with that of speech. How the brain transforms the corrupted acoustic signal into a reliable neural representation suitable for speech recognition, however, remains elusive. Here, we hypothesize that this transformation is performed at the level of auditory cortex through adaptive neural encoding, and we test the hypothesis by recording, using MEG, the neural responses of human subjects listening to a narrated story. Spectrally matched stationary noise, which has maximal acoustic overlap with the speech, is mixed in at various intensity levels. Despite the severe acoustic interference caused by this noise, it is here demonstrated that low-frequency auditory cortical activity is reliably synchronized to the slow temporal modulations of speech, even when the noise is twice as strong as the speech. Such a reliable neural representation is maintained by intensity contrast gain control and by adaptive processing of temporal modulations at different time scales, corresponding to the neural δ and θ bands. Critically, the precision of this neural synchronization predicts how well a listener can recognize speech in noise, indicating that the precision of the auditory cortical representation limits the performance of speech recognition in noise. Together, these results suggest that, in a complex listening environment, auditory cortex can selectively encode a speech stream in a background insensitive manner, and this stable neural representation of speech provides a plausible basis for background-invariant recognition of speech.},

	notes = {(216867) Very cool. Can be emphasized that intonation categories are probably much fuzzier than lexical ones(216883b) so this is where it gets counter-intuitive: it works nicely if we imagine that narrow and contrastive focus types are one attractor that is being used more or less (more=higher+later f0 peak). however, the broad focus does not really imply that we communicate any tonal event on the stressed syllable of the target word. it should imply the lack of attractors (so: somewhat falling with a downtrending contour, and randomly rising).(216861) not true for H*(216883a) Do rising and falling contours stand as categories? is it justifiable? (instead of modeling the 3 different focus types as the 3 categories).
this assumes that the control parameter gives us the competition between rising and falling pitch contours.(216884)}

Data were collected from forty typically developing Hebrew-speaking children between the ages of 1;10 and 3;0. The data were elicited by means of a picture-naming task combined with a sentence completion task. Target words consisted of complex onsets, including \#sC clusters. Results revealed that no significant differences were found between the correct productions of different sub-groups among the /s/-clusters. There were no differences in the correct productions of \#sC in relation to different C2's or between the productions of SSP-violating clusters and the SSP-following clusters. The only distinction that did emerge was the separate distribution of ‘/s/ + [−continuant]’ versus ‘/s/ + [+continuant]’, a result that supports previous findings for the role of continuity and sonority in the deletion patterns of clusters.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACTIndividuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often present atypical auditory perception. Previous work has reported both enhanced low-level pitch discrimination and superior abilities to detect local pitch structure on higher-level melodic tasks in ASD. However, it is unclear how low and high levels of auditory perception are related in ASD or typical development (TD), or how this relationship might change across development and stimulus presentation rates. To these aims, in the present study, children with ASD and TD were tested on a low-level pitch direction discrimination task and a high-level melodic global-local task. Groups performed similarly on both of these auditory tasks. Moreover, individual differences in low-level pitch direction ability predicted performance on the higher-level global-local task, with a stronger relationship in ASD. Age did not affect the relationship between low-level and high-level pitch performance in either ASD or TD. However, there was a more positive effec...}

	abstract = {Atypical responses to sound are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and growing evidence suggests an underlying auditory brainstem pathology. This review of the literature provides a comprehensive account of the structural and functional evidence for auditorybrainstem abnormalities in ASD. The studies reviewed were published between 1975 and 2016 and were sourced from multiple online databases. Indices of both the quantity and quality of the studies reviewed are considered. Findings show converging evidence for auditory brainstem pathology inASD, although the specific functions and anatomical structures involved remain equivocal. Two main trends emerge from the literature: (1) abnormalities occur mainly at higher levels of the auditory brainstem, according to structural imaging and electrophysiology studies; and (2) brainstemabnormalities appear to be more common in younger than older children with ASD. These findings suggest delayed maturation of neural transmission pathways between lower and higher levels of the brainstem and are consistent with the auditory disorders commonly observed in ASD, including atypicalsound sensitivity, poor sound localization, and difficulty listening in background noise. Limitations of existing studies are discussed, and recommendations for future research are offered.}

	abstract = {Sensory processing abnormalities are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the auditory domain, hyper- and hypo-sensitivity to sound, reduced orientation to speech, and difficulty listening in noise are commonly reported. However, the etiology of these auditory processing abnormalities is poorly understood. In this preliminary study, multi-talker speech perception thresholds, otoacoustic emissions, electrophysiological responses, as well as standardized measures of intellectual ability, language, and adaptive function were measured in each individual subject with ASD and their age-matched controls. Speech perception was assessed by estimating target-to-masker ratios at 50\% correct for speech targets (0° azimuth) presented with two spatially separated (±45° azimuth) simultaneous speech maskers. The electrophysiological battery used to characterize the transmission and representation of sound included: (1) a click-evoked supra-threshold auditory brainstem response, (2) an envelope following respo...}

Quantifying the sonority hierarchy. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA]. This study introduces a measure of spectral complexity, inspired by Shannon entropy, that ranks American English phonemes into a minimal version of the sonority hierarchy: vowels > approximants > nasals > fricatives > affricates > stops. Spectral complexity for every consonant and vowel in the TIMIT database was calculated by first parsing the phonemes into 20-ms segments and computing an FFT. For each short-term FFT, Shannon entropy was computed using the distribution of relative amplitudes (dB) across frequency. Average entropy across the FFTs was used to index spectral complexity for the phonemes, which were then sorted by sonority status. Results of a between-group comparison with spectral complexity as the independent variable and natural class as the dependent variable revealed the existence of six significantly different groups with spectral complexity ranking according to the sonority hierarchy. These findings suggest that Shannon entropy is a reliable acoustic correlate of sonority and may account for the combinatory patterns of co-occurrence of speech sounds in the speech stream.}

Data from six languages (English, Dutch, Norwegian, Croatian, Hebrew, and Polish) gathered from the productions of typically developing children and from children with phonological disorders are analyzed. While the languages belong to three different families, the results point to a universal tendency. Specifically, in the reductions of “s+stop” and “s+nasal” targets, the preference is the retention of C2, whereas in /sl/ and /sw/ targets, the clear pattern is in favor of the retention of C1. These patterns suggest that the continuancy of C2, not sonority, is the determining factor; C2 prevailed in “/s/+[-continuant]” targets, whereas C1 is retained in “/s/+[+continuant]” targets.}

Questions: 
	.	1)  What is understood by NSR, SNSR, CNSR and A-Deacc and what kind of effect do they have in relation to the phrasal prominence placement in Spanish and English?  
	.	2)  “To successfully acquire English-like NS, the language specific NRS algorithm must undergo restructuring” (p. 39) – Explain the consequences for Spanish L2 learners of English (Hypotheses).  
	.	3)  Explain the experiment: What participants were chosen, how was the procedure and the design of the study?  
	.	4)  What do the results show and what do they mean with regard to transfer from one’s native language to a second language?  
	.	5)  Explain Figure 10 (p. 59), how it depicts attractors and explain why not only the points x1 and x3 are observed when data is simulated with this system.  (72)}

	notes = {(3) (7) (3) (4) (3) (3) (0) Questions:
	•	Is there a difference between effects of word frequency and effects of word predictability?
"a growing body of research points to predictability as a strong predictor of observed effects on the speech signal in production and comprehension."
	•	What effect does the existence of minimal pairs in a language have on pronunciation? 
hyperarticulation in minimal-pair contexts functions to increase the distinctiveness of a word from contextually available competitors. This seems to also affect lexical representations of words. words that have minimal pairs in the lexicon (e.g. pill) are associated with slightly hyperarticulated pronunci-ations, compared to words without such minimal pair neighbors (e.g. pipe, which does not have the neighbor *bipe).
	•	Why is devoicing of plosives normally word final across languages? 
most distinctions appear word-initially... the end is informatively weaker and tends to neutralize more.
	•	Why do the authors consider the level of the MBU for their model as opposed to the level of sublexical units (such as phonological features, segments, biphones or syllables)? 
If the intended message were defined, for example, at the level of the segment, we would expect the allophone with the most robust cues, e.g. [th], to be preferred in contexts where the identity of the segment might otherwise be obscured. On the other hand, defining MBUs as the message predicts stronger allophones to occur in contexts that are especially important to distinguishing lexical items from other alternatives. -- The actual distribution of /t/ allophones is consistent with the latter approach (4) (3) (8) (6) (2) (3) (3) (3) (5) (3)}

Questions:  	1.	On the first page of the article, Pierrehumbert states that “[p]honological representations are abstract”. What does “abstract” mean and how is this word used by phonologists?  	2.	Why do we need an abstract representation of words instead of remembering exactly how a word has been pronounced?  	3.	Read the word "Kölsch" to yourself. What do you associate with this word? Do you remember ever hearing this word? What is your memory of the pronunciation?  	4.	Take the word "scalpel" or the German equivalent. How would the representation of this word differ in the mind of a school child and the mind of a surgeon?  
3. Prepare three questions about Pierrehumbert’s text yourself to discuss with the other students in the class(42) (36) (40) (40) (34) (37) (43b) (35) (40) (41(fn\#1)) (34) (46) hpwever, it could very well be that the representation of letters from orthography played a role in cementing this as a systematic behaviour.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we present data for the lognormal distributions of spike rates, synaptic weights and intrinsic excitability (gain) for neurons in various brain areas, such as auditory or visual cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, midbrain nuclei. We find a remarkable consistency of heavy-tailed, specifically lognormal, distributions for rates, weights and gains in all brain areas examined. The difference between strongly recurrent and feed-forward connectivity (cortex vs. striatum and cerebellum), neurotransmitter (GABA (striatum) or glutamate (cortex)) or the level of activation (low in cortex, high in Purkinje cells and midbrain nuclei) turns out to be irrelevant for this feature. Logarithmic scale distribution of weights and gains appears to be a general, functional property in all cases analyzed. We then created a generic neural model to investigate adaptive learning rules that create and maintain lognormal distributions. We conclusively demonstrate that not only weights, but also intrinsic gains, need to have strong Hebbian learning in order to produce and maintain the experimentally attested distributions. This provides a solution to the long-standing question about the type of plasticity exhibited by intrinsic excitability}

This review takes a personal perspective on the history of autism research. The origins of the first cognitive theories of autism, theory of mind and weak central coherence, are discussed and updated to inform future developments. Selected experimental findings are interpreted in the historical context of changes that have been brought about by advances in methodology. A three-level framework graphically illustrates a causal chain between brain, mind, and behaviour to facilitate the identification of phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders. Cognition is placed at the centre of the diagram to reveal that it can link together brain and behaviour, when there are complex multiple mappings between the different levels.}

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the perception and production of lexical stress and processing of affective prosody in adolescents with high-functioning autism (HFA). We hypothesized preserved processing of lexical and affective prosody but atypical lexical prosody production.
METHOD: Sixteen children with HFA and 15 typically developing (TD) peers participated in 3 experiments that examined the following: (a) perception of affective prosody (Experiment 1), (b) lexical stress perception (Experiment 2), and (c) lexical stress production (Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, participants labeled sad, happy, and neutral spoken sentences that were low-pass filtered, to eliminate verbal content. In Experiment 2, participants disambiguated word meanings based on lexical stress (HOTdog vs. hot DOG). In Experiment 3, participants produced these words in a sentence completion task. Productions were analyzed with acoustic measures.
RESULTS: Accuracy levels showed no group differences. Participants with HFA could determine affect from filtered sentences and disambiguate words on the basis of lexical stress. They produced appropriately differentiated lexical stress patterns but demonstrated atypically long productions, indicating reduced ability in natural prosody production.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with HFA were as capable as their TD peers in receptive tasks of lexical stress and affective prosody. Prosody productions were atypically long, despite accurate differentiation of lexical stress patterns. Future research should use larger samples and spontaneous versus elicited productions}

	abstract = {Individuals with autism exhibit significant impairments in prosody production, yet there is a paucity of research on prosody comprehension in this population. The current study adapted a psycholinguistic paradigm to examine whether individuals with autism are able to use prosody to resolve syntactically ambiguous sentences. Participants were 21 adolescents with high-functioning autism (HFA), and 22 typically developing controls matched on age, IQ, receptive language, and gender. The HFA group was significantly less likely to use prosody to disambiguate syntax, but scored comparably to controls when syntax alone or both prosody and syntax indicated the correct response. These findings indicate that adolescents with HFA have difficulty using prosody to disambiguate syntax in comparison to typically developing controls, even when matched on chronological age, IQ, and receptive language. The implications of these findings for how individuals with autism process language are discussed}

Inharmonic signal should fail when the task requires (also or only) the temporal dimension of pitch perception.(59) (60) (52) (61g) [my comment]:  super interesting!(62) (62) (53) (60) (59) (60) (60) (59) (62) (59) (60) (59) (60) (59) (61) (59) (59) (61) (59) (52) (61) (59) (60) (59) (59) (62) (61) (61) (60b) [my comment]: not "irrespective" as it is still better when the signal is harmonic.(59) (59) (59) (60) (52) (52) (59) (61) (59) (59c) [my comment]: This seems to answer my concerns but it's not clear enough to me whether it does that.(59) (61) (60)}

	abstract = {Phonological models of intonation use abstract categories, such as pitch accents, to build a bridge between continuous modulations in F0 contours (on the substantial side) and post-lexical meaning (on the functional side). However, recent research on Romance, Germanic, and non-Indo-European languages shows that sentence modality contrasts (i.e., question vs. statement) are often realized not only with different F0 contours, but also through differences in individual phone duration or global speech rate. If these durational differences were also used as a cue in the perception of sentence modality contrasts, phonological categories in current models of intonation would qualify as excessively underspecified, and they should be expanded in order to include phonetic information on the temporal dimension as well. In this paper we evaluate the role of durational differences as a cue to the perception of sentence modality contrasts in the Neapolitan regional variety of Italian. Read sentences were resynthesized by switching durational and intonational patterns of questions and statements, and used in a forced-choice identification task. The results show that listeners exclusively rely on F0, thus suggesting that, at least for this specific contrast in this specific variety, phonological representations of intonational contrasts do not need to be enriched with phonetic detail at the durational level.}

Stimuli included singleton and geminate /t/, /k/, /s/ followed by /a/ or /u/ produced by a native speaker in isolated words and carrier sentences. Results of a forced-choice identification task revealed a significant complex interaction involving all factors. Simple effects tests indicated scores for geminate /s/ followed by /u/ in carrier sentences were significantly lower across proficiency levels. The singleton-geminate contrast for /t, k/ was significant for beginning learners, marginal for low-intermediate, and nonsignificant for advanced. Duration differences did not account for all findings. Greater consonant-vowel sonority difference facilitated perception, enhancing mora boundaries for speech segmentation.

The main idea of the proposed method is based on the use of a time-frequency representation of the speech signal, and the fusion of intensity and voicing measures through various frequency regions for the automatic selection of pertinent information for the segmentation. The time-frequency representation is used to exploit the speech characteristics depending on the frequency region. In this representation, intensity profiles are measured to provide information into various frequency regions, and voicing profiles are measured to determine the frequency regions that are pertinent for the segmentation. The proposed method outperforms conventional methods for the detection of syllable landmark and boundaries on the TIMIT database of American-English, and provides a promising paradigm for the segmentation of speech into syllables.},

More recently, an alternative view has brought into focus the relationship between developmental markedness and language-specific input frequencies. With entirely original chapters on non-ambient-like productions by typically and atypically developing children, and second language learners, Unusual Productions in Phonology delves deeply into these competing explanations to show that patterns observed do not uniquely lend themselves to one or the other explanations. Rather, they point towards the need for both universal markedness and statistical input considerations in any attempted explanation. Containing contributions from leading researchers from around the world, this impressive collection is a must-have resource for any researcher, practitioner, or advanced student specializing in phonology, cognitive psychology, applied linguistics, and communication disorders"}

	notes = {(310) (14) (116) (see previouos comment)(6) (19) (75) Interesting points about declination and final lowering. It's hard to resist thinking that final lowering is the phonologization of declination. That doesn't even contradict Ladd's view for synchronic grammars, but it makes a nice plausible historical speculation that sits well also with the final rise in questions.(18) (33) (34) (38) (14) (12) (2) (12) (6) (11) (2) (210) Null indeed! :-)(10) (18) (30) (34) (36) (6) (36) (3) (186) (4) (18) (2) (175) (11) (7) (14) (170a) (172) A sobering conclusion!(32) (5) (2) (39) (236) here(2) (2) (0) (16) (21) (17) (12) (22) (4) (38) (169) The source of the wrong target!!!!(1) (12) (7) (31) (174-175) Segmental anchoring is not a strong support of the idea that turning points are tonal targets although it is in-line with this idea. Indeed, a rise across two syllables is expected to remain "a-rise-across-two-syllables" regardless of syllable length, giving rise to varying slopes and absolute durations, but not mormalized durations.(6) (17) (203-204) (37) (23) (205-206) (30) (23) (176) This almost feels like a misleading description on purpose. "Duration" is taken as an absolute term, measured in real time, completely disregarding the other, much much more plausible notion of normalized duration, measured in terms of syllables. Simply put, a rise across two syllables is expected rise across the entire 2 syllables, regardless of their duration. The range and scaling of this rise is also expected to be the same range and scaling, more or less, if spoken by the same speaker to convey a similar meaning. This will result in 2 residual points at the beginning (L*) and end (+H) of this rise, and their existence should not be confused with relevance.(179(fn.)) Delattre (1963) simply followed common sense (of hearing)!!!
AM divorced this common sense.(10) (66) Second source for the phonology of L \& H entities.(19) (1) 12Ish(25) (9) (171) Stressed +1... see point \#3 in "what if:" above(2) (8) (3) (192) (35) (38) (ix) (33) (21) (4) (21) (6) (8) (30) (4) (37) (22) (184) (35) (184b-185) (65) First source for the phonology of L \& H entities.(15) (35) (12) (5) (4) (19) (180) Right!!!
So the introduction of tonal association in contrast to tonal alignment is designed to solve this problem -- association is with the syllable as an abstract whole while alignment is to a point that is often before or after that whole.(170b) (36) Language--paralanguage distinction... interesting points.(33) (39) (5) (112) Great discussion about segmental categories in the context of explaining ToBI as non equivalent to the IPA, and how the IPA itself os problematic. The Scottish example is particularly interesting as it shows problems in mapping vowel spaces. It is a very good illustration of the idea that morphemes rather than segments are what counts as a "real" categories. That is because it can easily remain uncler which exact vowel the Scots use or not (compared to the vowel space of other English varieties), yet the words should be recoverable by speakers of different varieties (with some adjustments) without ever solving the vowel puzzle at hand.(20) (10) (29) (20) (134) Discussion about truning points.}

It is likely, however, that stop place of articulation is signaled quite efficiently in these sequences since acoustic place information is present both before and after the stop, i.e., both in [s] and in the vowel. These structures may thus have a perceptual advantage over those predicted by the sonority principle. This was corroborated by the present experiment which indicated that listeners are able to reliably perceive stop place of articulation on the sole basis of an adjacent [s]. It was thus concluded that the observed violation of the sonority principle may have a perceptual basis.}

At the same time the roles of phoneme position and phoneme class were taken into account in a fully balanced way. To this purpose, 141 kindergartners were presented with four phonemic-manipulation tasks consisting of the same 32 CVC items. Children performed better on phoneme blending and phoneme isolation compared to phoneme segmentation and phoneme deletion. However, performance between and within phoneme tasks appeared also to be dependent on phoneme position. Phoneme class exerted effects within the initial and final position of the four different tasks. The effect of plosives and fricatives compared to that of nasals and liquids on performance was particularly striking. Our findings were explained in terms of sonority and degree of co-articulation in pre-vocalic and post-vocalic plosives.}

In Experiment 1, target phonemes of monosyllabic English nonwords were varied in phonotactic context (e.g., (C)VC vs. (C)CVC), marginality (e.g., (C)CVC vs. C(C)VC), and/or position (e.g., (C)VC vs. CV(C)) in phoneme deletion and isolation tasks, with confounds such as global similarity, vowel length, and targets' sonority controlled. The fourth graders found the initial obstruent more difficult to isolate when it constituted the onset itself, i.e., (C)VC, than when it was part of a clustered onset, i.e., (C)CVC; no such difference was observed (non)word-finally, however. The results thus failed to support a subsyllabic preference for either onsets and rimes or bodies and codas. In Experiment 2, 49 second graders were tested on two other sets of phoneme awareness tasks and similar results were obtained. Items of one task were adapted}

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that there are special timing relations in syllable onsets. The consonants are assumed to be timed, on the one hand, with the vocalic nucleus and, on the other hand, with each other. These competing timing relations result in the C-center effect. However, the C-center effect has not consistently been found in languages with complex onsets. Moreover, it has occasionally been found in languages disallowing complex onsets. The present study investigates onset timing in German while discussing alternative explanations (not related to bonding) for the timing patterns observed. Six German speakers were recorded via Electromagnetic Articulography. The corpus contained items with four clusters (/sk/, /kv/, /gl/, and /pl/). The clusters occur in word-initial position, word-medial position, and across a word boundary preceding different vowels. The results suggest that segmental properties (i.e., oral-laryngeal coordination, coarticulatory resistance) determine the observed timing patterns, and specifically the absence or presence of the C-center effect.},

	abstract = {Intra-gestural and inter-gestural coordination in German word-initial consonant clusters /kl, kn, ks, pl, ps/ is investigated in four speakers by means of EMA as a function of segmental make-up and prosodic variation, i.e. prosodic boundary strength and lexical stress. Segmental make-up is shown to determine the extent of articulatory overlap of the clusters, with /kl/ exhibiting the highest degree, followed by /pl/, /ps/, /ks/ and finally /kn/. Prosodic variation does not alter this order. However, overlap is shown to be affected by lexical stress in /kl/ and /ps/ and by boundary strength in /pC/ clusters. This indicates that boundary effects on coordination are stronger for clusters with little inter-articulator dependence (e.g. lips + tongue tip in /pl/ vs. tongue back+tongue tip in /kl/). The results also show that the extent to which prosodic factors affect articulation interacts with the position of the affected segment in the sound sequence: In general, boundary strength strongly affects the cluster's first consonant while lexical stress influences the second consonant. This indicates that prosodic effects are strongest at their source (i.e. the boundary or the stressed nucleus) and decrease in strength with distance from their source. However, prosodic lengthening effects can reach the more distal consonant in clusters with a high degree of overlap and high inter-articulator dependence. Besides these aspects the discussion covers differences in measures of articulatory coordination.}

The internal structure of the clusters /kl, kn, ks, sk/ has been analyzed by means of EPG recordings from seven speakers of German. Derived temporal and spatial parameters indicate that /kn/ is consistently produced with a lag between the consonants and /kl/ with considerable overlap. This categorical difference is also stable across stress and boundary conditions and is attributed to manner-based and perceptual recoverability constraints. No clear pattern emerges for /sk/ and /ks/. Therefore, stability of temporal organization across prosodic conditions is only tested for /kl/ and /kn/. Temporally, boundary level affects the duration of the adjacent consonant and the overlap within the clusters /kn/ and /kl/, whereas spatially /k/ is affected only in /kn/ but not in /kl/. Stress effects are not restricted to the nucleus but also affect the internal organization of the clusters. The interplay between segmental and prosodic timing effects indicates that the internal structure of clusters shows linguistically crucial and highly constrained timing patterns which can only vary within certain limits.}

An account of phonological perception sketched here entails that markedness constraints reveal their presence by inducing perceptual 'repairs' to structures ungrammatical in the hearer's language. As onset clusters of falling sonority are typologically marked relative to those of rising sonority (Greenberg, 1978), we examine English speakers' perception of nasal-initial clusters-lacking in English. We find greater accuracy for rising-sonority clusters, evidencing knowledge of markedness constraints favoring such onset clusters. The misperception of sonority falls cannot be accounted for by stimulus artifacts (the materials are perceived accurately by speakers of Russian-a language allowing nasal-initial clusters) nor by phonetic failure (English speakers misperceive falls even with printed materials) nor by putative relations of such onsets to the statistics of the English lexicon}

	abstract = {Do speakers possess universal linguistic restrictions on the sound structure of their language? We examine this question by investigating the restrictions on onset clusters (e.g., bl in block). Cross-linguistic comparisons suggest that certain onset clusters are universally preferred: Onsets like bn are preferred to bd, which, in turn, are preferred to lb. In four experiments, we demonstrate that such preferences constrain onset identification by Spanish speakers: the worst formed the onset, the more likely its misidentification. Onset structure, however, determines not only the rate of disyllabic recoding but also its type. While better-formed onsets of rising sonority are repaired epenthetically (e.g., bnif→benif), worse-formed onsets are recoded prothetically (e.g., lbif→elbif), and the choice of repair (epenthesis vs. prothesis) is modulated by linguistic experience. These findings suggest that speakers possess broad linguistic restrictions that extend to structures unattested in their language, but the response to such putatively universal pressures is experience-dependent.}

	abstract = {In the very rich literature on phonotactics, the role of acoustic salience has sometimes been hinted but the topic has never been investigated in depth. In this paper, it is shown that factors like markedness, sonority and the Net Auditory Distance (a concept used in the Beats-and-Binding phonology framework) are not able to explain exhaustively certain phonotactic phenomena. I therefore attempt to bring experimental evidence that the role of salience is apparent in the perception of plateau clusters, i.e., obstruent clusters, nasal clusters and liquid clusters. The hypothesis is that the more salient a consonant, the more easily it will be perceived correctly as the first member of an initial plateau cluster and as the last member of a final plateau cluster. A salience scale is devised based on data from Italian and Dutch casual speech reductions, attested plateau clusters in the world's languages and former experimental studies. The results of the experiment, which presented nonce words containing plateau clusters as stimuli to Italian and Dutch native speakers, confirm the initial hypothesis for nasal and liquid clusters but only partially for obstruent clusters. It is suggested that the proposed salience scale has to be reformulated and that factors other than salience have to be taken into account.}

As a departure from conventional methods, we introduce an instantaneous speech rhythm estimator to predict possible regions where syllable nuclei can appear. Within a possible region, a simple slope based peak counting algorithm is used to get the exact location of each syllable nucleus. We verify the correctness of our method by investigating the syllable nuclei interval distribution in TIMIT dataset, and evaluate the performance by comparing with a state-of-the-art syllable nuclei based speech rate detection approach.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a direct method for speech rate estimation from acoustic features without requiring any automatic speech transcription. We compare various spectral and temporal signal analysis and smoothing strategies to better characterize the underlying syllable structure to derive speech rate. The proposed algorithm extends the methods of spectral sub- band correlation by including temporal correlation and the use of prominent spectral subbands for improving the signal correlation essential for syllable detection. Furthermore, to address some of the practical robustness issues in previously proposed methods, we introduce some novel components into the algorithm such as the use of pitch confidence for filtering spurious syllable envelope peaks, magnifying window for tackling neighboring syllable smearing, and relative peak measure thresholds for pseudo peak rejection. We also describe an automated approach for learning algorithm parameters from data, and find the optimal settings through Monte Carlo simulations and parameter sensitivity analysis. Final experimental evaluations are conducted based on a portion of the Switchboard corpus for which manual phonetic segmentation information, and published results for direct comparison are available. The results show a correlation coefficient of 0.745 with respect to the ground truth based on manual segmentation. This result is about a 17\% improvement compared to the current best single estimator and a 11\% improvement over the multiestimator evaluated on the same Switchboard database.},

The rationale for an experimental approach is presented in the first section, followed by a brief section on of some of the main theoretical issues involved. Section three then presents a recap of the most important empirical findings, focusing on the key factors involved, rather than the details of the specific results. Section four then presents an illustrative case where the experimental results seem to conflict, along with discussion of some of the factors that are likely responsible for this. Finally, in the last section, an appeal is made for a deeper theoretical perspective than the one that has guided research in this area heretofore.}

Most of Everett's concerns are directed toward the hypothesis that the phonological grammar is constrained by universal grammatical (UG) principles. Contrary to Everett's logical challenges, here I show that the UG hypothesis is readily falsifiable, that universality is not inconsistent with innateness (Everett's arguments to the contrary are rooted in a basic confusion of the UG phenotype and the genotype), and that its empirical evaluation does not require a full evolutionary account of language. A detailed analysis of one case study, the syllable hierarchy, presents a specific demonstration that people have knowledge of putatively universal principles that are unattested in their language and these principles are most likely linguistic in nature. Whether Universal Grammar exists remains unknown, but Everett's arguments hardly undermine the viability of this hypothesis}

Would be interesting at least data-wise if there were any data also about repair strategies of the "real" falling sonority clusters of Russian...(98) Good indication that top-down mechanisms are at play with syllable count tasks.(57) more of the same bollocks. gut für mich!(85) (73) interesting, but not crucial: cluster simplification by cochlear users is generally reminiscent of that of typically language acquiring kids.(100) Very interesting, but this one with the musical score isn't very relevant. Check out Obin et al. 2013 though!!! (also relevant to Xie and Niyogi 2006).(45) Interesting. may be comparable to periodic detection.(82) not very interesting but include references to "sonority-driven-stress" languages (where stress is attracted to the low vowel).(46) sounds good!(69) (18c) (108) Slightly weid, but otherwise, another example for proposals that try to expand on the idea of intensity to automatically locate syllables in speech. This one really goes around to get something that could yield quite similar results with much better perceptual grounding (measuring peridicity, duh).(94) very weird yet interesting in the elaborate predictions (e.g. different plateaus are different). check.(0) Great and helpful as always. One major problem persists here: What is the alleged source of sonority as a phonetic construct? Is it in articulation or perception? The absence of this distinction is apparent in the taxonmy of the appendix, as well as in the text (where the jump from kinematic to acoustic data receives no explanation).(65) hard to find, intriguing, yet not very promising.(64) loads of OT but worth checkin'(48) plateaus!!! check out! (not "classic" plateaus: all obstruents lumped together)(75) not very relevant... trying to target syllabification effects by priming (nice paradigm though).(44) Nice! NAP should cover that.(73) okay, not very relevant to clusters though.(68) not directly relevant as it is about articulation, but can add to the distinction beteween bottom-up and top-down parsing mechanisms.(47) (2a) (87) not directly relevant but features a mega-study with many participants showing the partial systemacity in syllabification of English words by speakers.  can also be interpreted in line with NAP's relative indifference to margins (sonority cares about nuclei!).(75) not so relevant (and not well-written).(54) more bs that can be beneficial to my pioint.(64) (61) classic berent.(59) same same.(62) check.(93) some nice data on clusters. should be checked.(80) More good complementary findings to NAP... motivating some universal phonotactics on non-syllabic grounds.(87) (74) (3d) (3b) (105) (86) (3) (84) Also interesting. Check thoroughly to understand how this reflects on NAP (this one has pseudo words as well so some issues here may be relegated to methodology).(17c) ( 104) Good overview and some novel (weird) data showing different behaviors with /sl/, /sn/, /st/. Fits well with NAP that doesn't find any of them extremely bad in sonority sense.(103) A-ha!(19b) (58) interesting, both for the spanish subjects and the distinction between prothetic and epenthetic repair vowels.(106) Really interesting examination of cross-liguistic inventory-size correlations. Similar divisions to those made in NAP (Obstruents, Sonorants, Vowels) and it reaches the conclusion that sonority is a primitive.(99) Interesting look at margins. concerns the idea that onsets prefer obstruents and codas prefer sonorants. this is arguably a sonority matter. In any case, this is not what they get but their interpertation isn't very clear.(63) good source for complementary non-sonority-based phonatctic preferences.(64) awesome! good source for complementary non-sonority-based phonatctic preferences.(85) not interesting!(2c-3) (97) Not much do to with sonority, but has good data for s-cluster reductions in acquisition.(51) (74) interesting articulatory, timing-related data about /s/ clusters.(61) (106) (59) great: nasal-initial clusters too!(49) (99) Some support for the idea that there are phonotactic universal biases before any substantial language experience. However, it's hard to tie this necessarily to sonority, and the results lump together all obstruents as the same category...(71) not so relevant (comparing OT learners).(47) (44) (107) should be relevant to the idea that competition drives more co-articulation/overlap of articulatory gestures.(19a) (84) (48) unclear but may actually follow NAP.(70) good (expected) evidence for top-down relevance in parsing.(51) maybe check. should support the idea that sonority has no problem with \#sC and other phonotactics can emerge for preferences.(109) Extension of Parker's (2002) problematic intensity measurements to 4 more languges reveals stability for differences between major groups and within sonorants but not obstruents.
Good example of the inability to produce constant values for discrete entities devoid of prosody.(91) (95) (77) right, syllabification of boundaries is not always clear, especially when a voiceless segment can syllabify either left or right.(79) should be addressed. not crucial.(76) not very relevant.(87) BS(18) (18a) (17d) (65) not very relevant, but shows interesting differences in perception of illegal /dl/ vs. unattested /bw/ in English. possible top-down evidence...(18e) (77) (80) Great complementary findings to NAP... motivating some universal phonotactics on non-syllabic grounds. Compatible with Wright 2004.(3c) (66) gives some indications, alongside Hoole et al. (2009), that overlap is increased with increased competition.(18d) (72) not clear but may be interesting in its suppert of a CV "privilege".(91) Interesting! an elaborate attempt to more properly define intensity. already exported with notes.(2b) (92) not very relevant but could be used to motivate the idea that nonce words in tasks are processed differently than non-linguistic sounds, and similarly to other linguistic material (due to the difference between the interferance caused by tones vs. syllables).(72) (106) Part of the whole "sonority projection" discussion. Shows that his learner can project sonority given a pre-oredered scale, a set of constraints and restricted input.(99) (94) (77) very short but nice indicatioon of the connection between segmental sonority and its relationship with local prosodic requirements.(3a) the third alternative would be to view sonority as a phenomena that guides parsing (in a continuous and dynamic fashion that is sensitive to attraction and competition in temporal space). As such, it is a major (albeit not unique) contributor to phonotactics. Segments do not carry a constant index value for sonority. However, major segmental groups, such as sonorant vocoids, sonorant contoids, voiced obstruents and voiceless obstruents, are inherently different in their competition potential due to differences in ability to transmit periodic energy.(90) not very clear but may join other evidence about the indecisiveness of sylllabifications at the margins (What is the functional purpose of deciding where consonants belong when they can satisfy nucleaus attraction in multiple ways?)(93) (89) (71) hard to interpret, but seems to support the division into 4 major sonority classes.(48) (82) (84) (86) (80) (17b) (58) (58) (85) interesing. can be interepreted via NAP as non-sonority related distinctions. also good support for methodology since they compare audio, visual and audio-visual stimuli which imply more top-down/phonological processing for orthography compared with audio stimuli.(83) Nice and interesting. May support the claim that sonority is a bottom-up, low-level, primitive processing procedure (as opposed to, e.g., syllabic parsing).(105) Not sonority according to NAP: they compare voiceless geminates before /a/ vs, /u/.(49) SCL is phonological? check...(67) (108) (107) Well, duh. :-) ... not very important: the hayes/wilson phonotactic learner fails in obtaining natural results. Maybe because it was never based on any real natural data (i.e. phonological features).(18b) (78) annoying, but requires addressing.(70) again, non-sonority related phonotactic universal concerning the transiency of a trapped consonant: /i/ < /n/ < /t/.(72) paper hard to obtain. more articulatory phonotactics with little connection to sonority...(80) (99) (47) check "deviations"...(46) (47) (83) Theoretically irrelevant with data tha seems comparable to normal acquisition.(100) (17a) (60) interesting. check.(101) Very important reference for a main point about sonority of schwa!(106) (94) Very complicated articulatory model for syllabic parsing. Should be considered as the other side of the syllabic coin!(105) (51) very interesting and hard to find!!! (a short report from jasa was found)(57) good experimental paradigm with cluster continua.(87) (96) (101) Very interesting, especially in the summary of previous works (Goedemans 1998 abd Gordon 2002) about perceptual energy in ways that fit with periodicity based accounts. Gordon's "trick" for the opposite trend with onsets (lower sonority is heavier) is to attribute this to "recovery" and "adaptation" perceptual processes and their ability to enhance or diminish following material.(48) (61) more results in support of NAP.(53) never mind the bollocks, this one has a very interesting experimental paradigm testing onset clusters with vowel duration continua.(96) not very relevant...(86) (88) Short and not very powerful statistically, but should be a great addition to Wright 2004 in explaining the [s] privilege.(18)}

	abstract = {Pitch relationships in music are characterized by their degree of consonance, a hierarchical perceptual quality that distinguishes how pleasant musical chords/intervals sound to the ear. The origins of consonance have been debated since the ancient Greeks. To elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these musical fundamentals, we recorded neuroelectric brain activity while participants listened passively to various chromatic musical intervals (simultaneously sounding pitches) varying in their perceptual pleasantness (i.e., consonance/dissonance). Dichotic presentation eliminated acoustic and peripheral contributions that often confound explanations of consonance. We found that neural representations for pitch in early human auditory cortex code perceptual features of musical consonance and follow a hierarchical organization according to music-theoretic principles. These neural correlates emerge pre-attentively within ~ 150 ms after the onset of pitch, are segregated topographically in superior temporal gyrus with a rightward hemispheric bias, and closely mirror listeners' behavioral valence preferences for the chromatic tone combinations inherent to music. A perceptual-based organization implies that parallel to the phonetic code for speech, elements of music are mapped within early cerebral structures according to higher-order, perceptual principles and the rules of Western harmony rather than simple acoustic attributes}

	abstract = {Language processing is a trait of human species. The knowledge about its neurobiological basis has been increased considerably over the past decades. Different brain regions in the left and right hemisphere have been identified to support particular language functions. Networks involving the temporal cortex and the inferior frontal cortex with a clear left lateralization were shown to support syntactic processes, whereas less lateralized temporo-frontal networks subserve semantic processes. These networks have been substantiated both by functional as well as by structural connectivity data. Electrophysiological measures indicate that within these networks syntactic processes of local structure building precede the assignment of grammatical and semantic relations in a sentence. Suprasegmental prosodic information overtly available in the acoustic language input is processed predominantly in a temporo-frontal network in the right hemisphere associated with a clear electrophysiological marker. Studies with patients suffering from lesions in the corpus callosum reveal that the posterior portion of this structure plays a crucial role in the interaction of syntactic and prosodic information during language processing.},

It is he inerval between formants rather than their absolute frequency values that matters so it seems like an invalid comparison. 
Moreover, it seems a bit problematic to talk about formant content of flaps -- most of the vocalic energy in the flap arises from the surrounding vowels while the flap itself is a short weak transient spike between vowels (implying short formant transitions towards and from the front high vowel space).(36) but not necessarily. this also invokes the notion of a prototype.(0) (45) i.e. words are not "lexical items" but a bundle of neuronal activations. nice!(35b) Indeed, because the vocalic content surrounding the flap detemines most of the formant distrtibution here.(37) provided there's a context -- an "episodic" memory to anchor that phonological memory.}

As such it depends on different language-specific tendencies to incorporate glides within nuclei.(1178c) (1178b) (1161) (1170) (1165c) (1164c) (1163) (1172) (1172a) (1171b) (1176b) (my comment): I agree, but in my model this happens both within the periodic structure (categorical, segmental) description, and due to periodic strength (prosodic, supra-segmental). In the former this can be witnessed with some Rhotics (e.g. ʁ) that can appear on a continuum between fricatives and approximants. In the latter case, prominency (and nuclusity in the case of syllabic consonants) can drive the periodic strength of some speech portion above their norm (which explains why Schwa can be lowest amongst vowels in sonority due to it being reduced, and in spite of it being central, not high).(1165b) (1171c) (1168) (1162) (1163) (1170) (1178a) (1164b) (1169b) (1179) (1171d) (1164) (1178)}

The ERB of the auditory filter is a little larger than the 3 dB bandwidth. In what follows, the mean ERB of the auditory filter determined using young listeners with normal hearing and using a moderate noise level is denoted ERBN (where the subscript N denotes normal hearing). ... Sometimes it is useful to plot psychoacoustical data on a frequency scale related to ERBN, called the ERBN-number scale. For example, the value of ERBN for a centre frequency of 1 kHz is approximately 132 Hz, so an increase in frequency from 934 to 1066 Hz represents a step of one ERBN-number. The formula relating ERBN-number to frequency is (Glasberg \& Moore 1990) 
(2.2) [see image for equation]
where F is the frequency in hertz. Each one-ERBN step on the ERBN-number scale corresponds approximately to a constant distance (0.9 mm) along the basilar membrane (Moore 1986). The ERBN-number scale is conceptually similar to the Bark scale (Zwicker \& Terhardt 1980), which has been widely used by speech researchers, although it differs somewhat in numerical values.(956c) (956) (956) (949) (955c-956) (956a) (956g) (956d) (955) (956) (956e) (949) (956) (956f) (958)}

The results show the effects of this attraction causing strong variation the bigger the periodic mass is. It is imortant to note that while the meta-linguistic task is discrete, the underlying mechanisms (attraction of nuclei to periodic masses) are not. Hence, variation is the result of increasing uncertainty in the translation from continuous cognitive processes to discrete task requirements. This should also explain large intra-speaker variation.(11) (20) (14) (10) (12) (15) (17) (16) (8a) (12-13) An important observation is that the liquid codas, /n/, and /d/ all contribute a substantial amount of duration to /ai/-nucleus rimes ... but in rimes with a low vowel /a/ nucleus, the liquids do not contribute a substantial amount of duration to the rime: only the /n/ and /d/ codas re-sult in significantly greater rime duration; ... high-front/tense vowel: /il/ and /ir/ rime durations are significantly greater than open /i/ rime durations; however, in these rimes, /n/ and /d/ codas contribute even more dura-tion, resulting in rime durations that are significantly greater than /il/ and /ir/. ... /ail/ and /air/ rimes are significantly greater than /al/ and /ar/ rimes, respectively. These patterns indicate that across participants there is a general trend for liquid codas to contrib-ute extra duration to the rime in variable-count words, i.e. in words with diphthong or high/front tense vowel nuclei.(8b) (13) (12) (9) (13)}

The time scales associated with each type of dynamics are discussed, and an outline is provided of the role played by each type in the developing organism. In particular, the role of parameter dynamics and graph dynamics in producing qualitative, bifurcational changes in behavior is described. It is concluded that all three types of dynamics are required for a complete description of skill acquisition and development.}

The logistic map is an iterated simulation of a continuous dynamical system in which the value of y at time t is inserted back into the equation to produce the value of y at time t + 1, which is then inserted into the equation again to produce the next value of y, and so on.(301b) (88) (249a) (77) (266) (123-124) (146) (127-128) (266) (313) (76a) (107) (20) (83) (252) (151) (47) (156-157) (263) (112) Homework 9.1.2019 
Read the following pages of Spivey (2007) chapter 4: 95-107 starting at “A Demonstration Arena for Probabilistic Dynamic Competition: Normalized Recurrence”. 
How could the beer network look like? Draw a picture. The description starts roughly on page 100. 
Please also bring the homework for last session: your summary of the ham-hamster- experiment and ideas how to connect it to exemplar theory.(323) (119b) (107) (134-135) In figure 5.8,the salience maps are depicted as two-dimensional topographically arranged layers of neurons, where the height dimension indicates the increased sensitivity exhibited by a local group of neurons when their input is partially attended (or salient). The supramodal salience map continuously updates its pattern as a combination of the salience maps that feed into it.(154) (33) (184) (214) (152) (322) (83-84) The logistic function, figure 4.2, is an elegant symmetric model of a generic s-curve-shaped process.[1] The logistic function is used in physics for subatomic particle identification and event classification, in chemistry for saturation processes, in biology for species population dynamics; the list goes on. In statistics, to convert a log-likelihood ratio of two alternatives into a probability, one uses the logistic equation. In neuroscience, the logistic function is used to approximate the average firing rate of a neuron (e.g., Britten et al., 1992) as well as the probability of a neuron carrying out a single action potential (e.g., Burnod \& Korn, 1989). The logistic function is also used in connectionist simulations of a neuronlike unit summing its linear inputs and then squashing that value to a range between 0 and 1 (see Rumelhart \& McClelland, 1986a). And sigmoidal curves are routinely observed in “microgenetic” studies of children in the process of transitioning from one developmental stage to the next (see Siegler \& Crowley, 1991).(276) (154) (174) (256) (146) (128) (327) (90) (37) (275) (362) (129-130) (305-306) (77-78) (262) (111) (137) (129) (320) (266) (279) (249b) (131) (20) (172) (11) (77) (16) (78) (153) (249c-250) (119a) (135-136) (60-61) (166) (124) to here(340) (184) (131) (131) (141) (118a) (323-324) (89) (394) (95) (341) (119c) (53) (166-167) (34) (15) (102) (114-115) (300) (202-203) (76b) (145) (303-304) Figure 11.4A presents a schematic depiction of three bodies (and brains) ... moving in space as a function of time. ... In figure 11.4A, two bodies travel near one another for a period of time, then they diverge, and one of them begins traveling near a different body. Because time is fractal, or self-similar, in this framework, the scale of the temporal dimension for these interactions could be just about anything. The bodies could be interacting over the course of minutes (going from one hallway conversation to another), over the course of hours (going from one meeting to another), over the course of weeks or years or decades (going from one friendship/relationship to another). 
For a fuzzy externalist, the depiction of these trajectories looks importantly different when they are defined over how the minds interact instead of how the bodies interact. Note in figure 11.4B how the fuzzy set distributions merge as they approach each other. When two bodies are particularly close in space (and presumably close in other nondepicted semantic dimensions), the envelope of their distributions approaches having one mode instead of two. This demonstration offers a portrayal of how multiple different brains can cohere to such a degree that they function, at least to some extent, as though they were one mind: a “shared manifold of intersubjectivity” (Gallese, 2003; see  also  Sonnenwald  \&  Pierce’s, 2000, interwoven  situational  awareness). The findings described in this chapter suggest that many of the interfacing links that maintain this shared manifold are the spatial indices that connect bundles of information in one brain to bundles of information in other brains via bundles of information in the environment.(132) (201) (107) (267) (68) Continuity in Phonology – 21.11.2018 
Homework 
Read the following sections of Spivey 2007 Ch. 3: 
	•	“The Purple Perils”  	•	“On the Continuity of Your Measure”  	•	“Continuous Measures With Continuous Tasks”  	•	“Eye Tracking and Mouse Tracking”  Answer the following questions:  
	1.	From the perspective of experimental cognitive psychology: Why does it seem natural to think that the activity of the mind consists of a series discrete internal states? What is the alternative proposed in this chapter?
Collecting dicrete forced-choice response accuracies, and off-line ratings obscures the temporal dimension of tasks and the continuous trajectory towards responses. This chapter suggests that experimental design that consider the temporal dynamics as well.  
	2.	In figure 3.1, the same function is shown with different scales for the x-axes. What does the x-axis denote in this example? What does the y-axis show? How does the example illustrate the importance of experimental measures that take temporal dynamics into account? 
The x-axis is time, y-axis show activation from 0 to 1. At low time resolutions (A,B), the change in activation seems to be binary, while at too high time resiolutions (D) the change appears to be contimuous and incomplete. The apropriate timeresolution (C) correctly shows the change to be gradual between two discrete points. 
	3.	On p. 65 an experiment about rhythmic motor behaviour is described in which people are tasked to move the index fingers at different speeds. Try it yourself. What is said in the text about the results? Can you relate it to what you know about attractors? 
At some point we move towards an anti-phase pattern -- i.e. we are attracted to the stable pattern of attractors. 
	4.	Explain the difference between Figure 3.7 and 3.8. What does “cohort competitor” mean? 
In 3.7 only one attractor seems to be active. In 3.8 the cohort competitor (shaing similar onset) is active enough to affect response, even when it is not selected. (98) (240) (139) (32) (57) (258-259) (147) (320) (330) (321) (281) (311) [my comment]: just like in reporting a dream...(301a) (220) (141) (118b) (138) (320) (322) (57) (275) (264) Figure 10.1. At the time scale of reasoning and problem solving, where changes in the environment might be conceived of as discrete, the continuity of mind thesis (A) still assumes dynamical cognitive processes, whereas the symbolic framework (B) posits an intermediate mental stage in which discrete symbols are operated on by logical rules.}

	notes = {(109) (109) (111) (109) (108) One  solution  would  be  for listeners to extrapolate the missing F0 peak based on observed trajectories to either side of the gap. (Fig.  1a.) [...] Bregman  [4] and  Ciocca and  Bregman  [5] conclude on  this  basis  that  listeners do  not extrapolate missing peaks or valleys, but instead integrate disjoint pitch movements by interpolating directly between them. (See Fig. 1b.) [...] In a  manner somewhat akin to what Dennett [7] describes as “ignoring an absence”, listeners may not actually “fill in” missing F0 at all, but rather simply skip over or ignore it for purposes of judgments about F0 events. (Fig. 1c[...])(108) (111) Dennett,  D.  1992.  “Filling  in”  versus  finding  out:  a ubiquitous  confusion  in  cognitive  science.  In  Pick  Jr, H.L., van den Broek, P., Knill, D.C. (eds.), Cognition: Conceptual and Methodological Issues. Washington, D. C.: American Psych. Assoc.(110) p. 111: If listeners “fill in” F0 gaps by extrapolating missing peaks, then date should sound higher than day-long. It did not.  Likewise,  if  listeners  instead  fill  in  using linear interpolation, then date should sound equal in scaling to day-long, and higher than day-short. Again, it did not. Instead, date, with its missing F0 “plateau”, sounded the same as day-short, with a sharp peak such as would result from removing the voiceless interval in date from the signal entirely. For F0  scaling  perception,  then,  it  appears  as though listeners do not “fill in” missing F0 at all. Instead,  they  seem  to  disregard  the  voiceless interval entirely, perceiving scaling just as if it had never been present to begin with.}

Various names have been used for such a hierarchy, e.g., 'sonority hierarchy' (Hankamer and Aissen 1974),  'strength hierarchy' (Foley 1970, 1977, Vennemann 1972, Hooper 1976), 'vowel adherence' (Sigurd 1955), and 'vowel affinity' (Fujimura 1975,  Fujimura and Lovins 1977), but the rank-ordering of segments is basically the same in all cases. Hooper (1976) proposed the following ranking for a supposedly universal 'strength hierarchy.' According to this hierarchy, obstruents are characterized as the 'strongest' segments as opposed to vowels which are the 'weakest.'  Among the obstruents, voiceless stops are 'stronger' than fricatives and voiced stops. Ordinarily, voiceless obstruents are 'stronger' than voiced ones. Nasals are generally 'stronger' than liquids which are in turn 'stronger' than glides.(13-14) 10. It should be mentioned in conjunction with this that universal preferences also exist with regard to the ordering of these con­ sonants. Greenberg showed that liquids generally followed obstruents in initial clusters, but preceded obstruents in final  clusters. When a liquid and a nasal are combined, the ordering tends to be such that the liquid is closer to the vowel, i.e., nasal + liquid initially, and liquid + nasal finally. Inciden­tally, though both liquids and nasals are frequently combined with obstruents, obstruent + liquid sequences are preferred to obstruent + nasal sequences at least in the initial position.(169) (59) (52) (171c-172) (60) (140) (27) (58) (50-51) (192) (11b) (38-39) The 'sonority hierarchy' proposed by Hankamer and Aissen is just a mirror-image of the 'strength hierarchy,1 with vowels, the most  'sonorous' segments, placed at the higher end of the scale, and stops, the least 'sonorous,' at the other end. According to Heffner (1960), segments are ranked on 'sonority' as follows. Hooper (1976) points out the striking similarity between the 'sonority' and 'strength' hierarchies except for the inverse relationship. The notion of 'sonority' has a long history in phonological literature. It was mentioned in conjunction with syllable structure by Sievers (1893), Jespersen (1904) and Saussure (1916), and more recently by Hala (1961)  and Kramsky (1971) among others. They noted that the syllable nucleus was occupied by the most 'sonorous' sound, normally a vowel. Farther away from the nucleus is a less 'sonorous' sound, and on both syllable margins are found the least 'sonorous' ones. Various impressionistic  parameters such as acoustic energy, audibility, tonality, and relative degree of aperture have been suggested without stringent experimental verification as a basis for the ranking in 'sonority.'(39-40) (57) (31) (41-42) (55) (189) (41) (58) (44) (174-175)}

During a VIV transition period, pro(x, y) is slightly reduced with respect to values obtained during the steady portion of the sound, as can be seen in Fig. 2 for the three successive voiced segments /o/, /m/, and /wha/ of the word somewhat. This momentary drop is followed by a fast recovery to high correlation values as soon as the new sound becomes stationary.(40) (43) (40) (43) (40) (40) (43) (40) (43) (43) (41) (41) (43) (45) (43) (44) (41) (43) (42) (40) (40) (40) (42) (43) (40) (43) (42) (40) (43) (45) (42)}

The strength of aperiodicity defined as the average number of spurious dips across all the channels, can be used to distinguish strident fricatives from nonstrident and voiced ones from their unvoiced counterparts. This strength of aperiodicity is tabulated in Table IX. Table IX shows that, for a particular place, the degree of ran-domness in the distribution of the AMDF dips differs consider-ably for the voiced versus unvoiced obstruents. Further, as ex-pected, the degree of randomness is more for strident fricatives and considerably less for the nonstrident fricatives.(784) (784) (776) (784) PERCENTAGE OF FRAMES IN DIFFERENT BROAD CLASSES OF THE MOCHA DATABASE WHERE ONLY STRONG PERIODICITY WAS DETECTED,STRONG APERIODICITY WAS DETECTED AND BOTH STRONG PERIODICITY AND APERIODICITY WERE DETECTED.NUMBERS IN PARENTHESIS SHOW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FRAMES IN EACH CATEGORY(785) Fig. 9.

As should be clear from the examples given above, the magnitude of shape effects on the location of TCoG is typically relatively small in comparison with the magnitude of the differences that can be achieved by shifting the ‘anchor points’ of the pitch movements in question. In this sense, from an articulatory point of view, TP-alignment may prove to be a particularly economical means of implementing differences in TCoG-alignment.(370) (39) (343) 7. In this initial implementation of TCoG, we include only sample F0 as a weighting factor. Ultimately, it will be necessary to include additional weighting factors as well, corresponding to the variety of additional acoustic parameters known to influence the perception of pitch, e.g., segment intensity, or some derivate thereof ( Niebuhr 2007b; Barnes et al. 2011a, 2011b).(368) Summary chart: left-weighting and right-weighting shape modifications. Solid lines show changes in F0 shape and vertical black lines show resulting change in perceived alignment.(365) (6) (377) (355) (36) (35) (41) (26) (342d) (39) (40) (37) (26) (40) (351a) [my emphasis in bold](40) (338b) (340) (373) (371) (355) (368) (353) 16.  House’s theory rests on the idea that certain properties of the signal (in particular, spectral stabil-ity or instability with a given region) are responsible for altering the robustness of tonal perception. His model, however, locates target windows for extracting average F0 values not directly via these properties, but rather using a temporally fixed window, during which he argues that the properties in question tend to be found.(29) (36) (38) (377) (342a) (6) (355c-356) (355a) (352b) (351c) (35) (32) (356) (38) (374) (339) (37) (38) (36) (342c) (374) (342b) (39) (6) (36) (378) (360)}

	abstract = {We present a novel subliminal priming technique that operates in the auditory modality. Masking is achieved by hiding a spoken word within a stream of time-compressed speechlike sounds with similar spectral characteristics. Participants were unable to consciously identify the hidden words, yet reliable repetition priming was found. This effect was unaffected by a change in the speaker's voice and remained restricted to lexical processing. The results show that the speech modality, like the written modality, involves the automatic extraction of abstract word-form representations that do not include non-linguistic details. In both cases, priming operates at the level of discrete and abstract lexical entries and is little influenced by overlap in form or semantics.}

	abstract = {Due to its aerodynamic, articulatory, and acoustic complexities, the fricative /s/ is known to require high precision in its control, and to be highly resistant to coarticulation. This study documents in detail how jaw, tongue front, tongue back, lips, and the first spectral moment covary during the production of /s/, to establish how coarticulation affects this segment. Data were obtained from 24 speakers in the Wisconsin x-ray microbeam database producing /s/ in prevocalic and pre-obstruent sequences. Analysis of the data showed that certain aspects of jaw and tongue motion had specific kinematic trajectories, regardless of context, and the first spectral moment trajectory corresponded to these in some aspects. In particular contexts, variability due to jaw motion is compensated for by tongue-tip motion and bracing against the palate, to maintain an invariant articulatory-aerodynamic goal, constriction degree. The change in the first spectral moment, which rises to a peak at the midpoint of the fricative, primarily reflects the motion of the jaw. Implications of the results for theories of speech motor control and acoustic-articulatory relations are discussed}

	abstract = {The question of Jewish ancestry has been the subject of controversy for over two centuries and has yet to be resolved. The “Rhineland hypothesis” depicts Eastern European Jews as a “population isolate” that emerged from a small group of German Jews who migrated eastward and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the “Khazarian hypothesis” suggests that Eastern European Jews descended from the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans that settled the Caucasus in the early centuries CE and converted to Judaism in the 8th century. Mesopotamian and Greco–Roman Jews continuously reinforced the Judaized empire until the 13th century. Following the collapse of their empire, the Judeo–Khazars fled to Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore explained by the contribution of the Judeo–Khazars. Thus far, however, the Khazars’ contribution has been estimated only empirically, as the absence of genome-wide data from Caucasus populations precluded testing the Khazarian hypothesis. Recent sequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the Khazarian hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland hypothesis. We applied a wide range of population genetic analyses to compare these two hypotheses. Our findings support the Khazarian hypothesis and portray the European Jewish genome as a mosaic of Near Eastern-Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby consolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry. We further describe a major difference among Caucasus populations explained by the early presence of Judeans in the Southern and Central Caucasus. Our results have important implications for the demographic forces that shaped the genetic diversity in the Caucasus and for medical studies.}

	abstract = {The ontogeny of linguistic functions in the human brain remains elusive. Although some auditory capacities are described before term, whether and how such immature cortical circuits might process speech are unknown. Here we used functional optical imaging to evaluate the cerebral responses to syllables at the earliest age at which cortical responses to external stimuli can be recorded in humans (28- to 32-wk gestational age). At this age, the cortical organization in layers is not completed. Many neurons are still located in the subplate and in the process of migrating to their final location. Nevertheless, we observed several points of similarity with the adult linguistic network. First, whereas syllables elicited larger right than left responses, the posterior temporal region escaped this general pattern, showing faster and more sustained responses over the left than over the right hemisphere. Second, discrimination responses to a change of phoneme (ba vs. ga) and a change of human voice (male vs. female) were already present and involved inferior frontal areas, even in the youngest infants (29-wk gestational age). Third, whereas both types of changes elicited responses in the right frontal region, the left frontal region only reacted to a change of phoneme. These results demonstrate a sophisticated organization of perisylvian areas at the very onset of cortical circuitry, 3 mo before term. They emphasize the influence of innate factors on regions involved in linguistic processing and social communication in humans}

	abstract = {English consonant recognition in undegraded and degraded listening conditions was compared for listeners whose primary language was either Japanese or American English. There were ten subjects in each of the two groups, termed the non‐native (Japanese) and the native (American) subjects, respectively. The Modified Rhyme Test was degraded either by a babble of voices (S/N=−3 dB) or by a room reverberation (reverberation time, T=1.2 s). The Japanese subjects performed at a lower level than the American subjects in both noise and reverberation, although the performance difference in the undegraded, quiet condition was relatively small. There was no difference between the scores obtained in noise and in reverberation for either group. A limited‐error analysis revealed some differences in type of errors for the groups of listeners. Implications of the results are discussed in terms of the effects of degraded listening conditions on non‐native listeners’ speech perception.}

	abstract = {Conducted 9 experiments with a total of 663 undergraduates using the technique of priming to study the nature of the cognitive representation generated by superordinate semantic category names. In Exp I, norms for the internal structure of 10 categories were collected. In Exps II, III, and IV, internal structure was found to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to identical poor members of a category. Exps V and VI showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (e.g., lines or angles), but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Exps VII and VIII showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled Ss to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception. Exp IX suggested that good examples of semantic categories are not physiologically determined, as the effects of the internal structure of semantic categories on priming (unlike the effects for color categories) could be eliminated by long practice.

in any case, it's hard to imagine why F1 frequency in itself should be relevant to any sonority-based generalization. if anything, the intensity of F1 should be measured, not its frequency band.(179b) (85) (69-70) (259) (66) (148) (127-128) (201) (164) (185) (60) (136) (53) (62b) (187b) (213) (155) (227) (72) (239-240) (68) (210) (74) (18-19) (68-69) (47-48) (241) (71) (250) (62a) (108) (22b) [my comment]: MSD only dictates minimal sonority distance between two consonants in a cluster such that if OL is good, OG is as good.(71) (214-215) (72) (72) (157) (138) (153) (109-111) (73) (236-237) (97) (107-108) [my comment]: very problematic. measuring just general acoustic loudness by eyeballing specific points. voiceless stops minima is always closest to 0 this way, but that's hardly a stop's perceived intensity. what about the aperiodic transient burst? inaudible?](252) (239) [my comment]: Tashlhiyt data may reflect phonotactics that are insensitive to sonority in terms of periodicity but rather to articulatory and duration based limitations.(71-72) (199) (133) (109) (144) (44-46) (96) (29) [my comment]: 2 of these examples (consonant strength in Ito and reduplicative nonce forms in English) do not appeal to the succession of different sonority levels in a adjacent segments (as in standard phonotactics which would be directly relevant to the attraction model), but, rather, to interesting language-specific sonority-based restrictions on the succession of onsets or codas within a phrase (e.g. roly-poly, willy-nilly). The other 2 examples (consonant assimilation in Pali and Sanskrit reduplication) show simplification patterns in which the least sonorous segment survives in the onset positions (or as a coda-onset geminates).(248) (178) (70) (121-122) [my comment]: this is hardly convincing. the raw results before grouping do not show a negative correlation -- they simply show zero correlation, with, e.g. /i/ and /u/ occupying two extremes of the female results. the fact theat grouping neutralizes this trend doesn't cover it up (and the following pitch-based explanation does not explain it either).(68) (137) (156a) (72) (71) (24-25) (22c-23) (152) (91) (72) (69) (63-64) (265) (71) (263) (59a) (152) (102) (135) (71) (242) (161) [my comment]: I disregard the following comparable F1 measurements for the Spanish speakers, p. 161-167(106) (131) (161) (61) 
(154) (262) (73) (263) (154) (73) (160) (26a) (168) (259) (79-80) (176) (7-8) (27b) (222) (34) (49-50) (236) (133) [my comment]: same problems as with english, only milder...(86) (231) (95) (96) (134) (90) (174) (45) (51) (124) [my comment]: this seems like a very serious problem for the intesity-based correlation.(240) (167) (65)}

	notes = {(168) As this chart shows, these classes are fully distinguished from each other by phonological features, except for vowels, which are distinguished from semivowels by their function as syllable peaks. The positive value of each feature is generally more reso-nant than the negative value, all else being equal. [...] The sonority scale may thus be grounded in the perceived resonance of major classes of speech sounds, as defined in terms of the features shown at the head of each column in (2).(170) (167) 2. In a related suggestion, Nathan (1989) has proposed that sonority is a function of relative loudness, voicing, svara (formant structure), and prolongability.(171) (170) (168) (167) (166) Several methods of ranking speech sounds in terms of power and relative audibility have been described by Fletcher (1972:82-86). Of the various measures proposed, the one that yields a result closest to the sonority scale is a composite measure of relative phonetic power, taking the power of the weakest sound as the basis of comparison. The ratio of powers between the weakest sound, /θ/, and the most powerful sound, /ɔ/, is 680, amounting to a difference of 28 dB. The full ranking of English speech sounds is given in (1). [...] This ranking fits commonly proposed sonority scales quite well. The major anomaly is the high rank of voiceless sibilants, one of which, /ʃ/, outranks all nasals. Sibilants, though rather noisy sounds, do not pattern as high-sonority sounds in most languages.(167) (174) (167) (167-168) (166) 1. Other phoneticians, from Jespersen (1932) to Beckman, Edwards, and Fletcher (1992), have related sonority to the degree of opening of the vocal tract.(166) (173) (169) (169) 4. This analysis can be stated formally as a constraint against the feature combination *[+sonorant, –voiced]. It appears that many so-called voiceless sonorants, if not all, can be better analyzed as bearing the feature [spread glottis] (e.g., Lombardi 1994, Clements 2003); whether these sounds ever pattern as true sonorants remains an open question.(169) (165) (168) (168) (167) (168) (169-170) (168) 3. For reasons discussed in Clements and Osu 2002, [sonorant] and [obstruent] may constitute distinct features.(165) (169) (166) (171) (174) (174) (166) (170-171) (167) (173) (168) (170) (170) (168) (170) (166) (169) (173) (168) (167)}

Another explanation that has been offered for these altered timing patterns is based on House's Spectral Stability Hypothesis [16, 7, 24], whereby pitch movements are more readily perceived as such when they are realized during regions of spectral stability. For reasons of space, we will not treat this hypothesis further here, other than to note that it relates less obviously to the distributional restrictions on lexical tones noted above.(1126) (1126) (1126) (1125) (1125) (1125) (1126) (1126) (1126) (1128) (1126) (1127) the bulk of experimental trials consisted of the pairing of a given target item (i.e. a target utterance with day, Dane, or Dave, with either a peak- or plateau-shaped pitch accent) with one out of a continuum of standard reference contours.  These reference contours were segmentally identical to the target item, but F0 throughout the accented syllable was held steady at one of 7 levels [...] If we assume that corresponding level standards sound identical in scaling regardless of syllable type, since sonority-related weighting variation cannot change perceived pitch for a flat-F0 contour, then any effects of F0 weighting differences on tokens with changing F0 should be manifest in subjects' perception of the relative scaling of target items and their respective level standards. (E.g., day might sound equal in pitch to its standard level 5, while Dave might reach only level 4.)(1125) (1126) (1126) (1125) (1126) (1127) (1128) (1126) (1126) (1128) (1126) (1125) (1126) (1127)}
