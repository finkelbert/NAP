## Stimulus Considerations {-} 
<!-- {#sec:considerationlist} -->
The following list summarizes concerns that were taken into consideration when constructing the stimulus set (see the full set in Table \@ref(tab:targetlist)):

* Glides were excluded from the experimental set due to their complex status, which is dependent on both structure and theory: a glide in the nucleus is considered a vowel, while a glide immediately adjacent to a nuclear vowel may be analyzed as a vowel in the nucleus, or as a consonant in the onset or coda positions, depending on language and analysis (namely, this depends on whether the language is considered to have *diphthong* or not, in itself not always a simple determination). Furthermore, clusters with glides in C~1~ are predicted to be ill-formed in all the models we consider, while clusters with glides in C~2~ are predicted to be well-formed in all of them. We do not expect them to be very informative with respect to our comparison.

*	For the class of liquids, only the lateral /l/ is used, disregarding the sub-class of *rhotics* that are phonetically very varied and highly inconsistent between different languages in terms of phonetic detail. This is also true for the liquids of two languages used in this study, Hebrew and German, that use a similar /l/ and more varied rhotics.

*	The alveolar /s/ is used for the class of voiceless sibilants (voiceless coronal fricatives). In C~1~ positions, the post-alveolar /ʃ/ is also used to control for potential language-specific effects that may appear due to specific restrictions on /s/. For example, in German /ʃC/ onset clusters can be licit, while /sC/ onset clusters occur only marginally in loanwords.

*	Stops are used only in C~2~ position, and only voiceless stops are used in order to keep the size of the stimulus set reasonably small. Stops in C~1~ position are avoided since as the phrase-initial position in the stimulus, it is practically devoid of acoustic cues for the closure phase of the stop [see @barry1984place], such that only the final transient burst serves as the acoustic trace of the stop in such clusters. Furthermore, note that all the stop-initial clusters (with the exclusion of *stop-stop* plateaus) are generally well-formed according to all the sonority models tested here, such that their informative *value* in this comparison is smaller than their *cost* in terms of the size of the stimulus set.

* The set includes one instance of a dorsal consonant, /k/, which appears instead of the coronal /t/ as an alternative to a labial-coronal cluster, which would have required a labial liquid. Instead, the *coronal-dorsal* cluster /lk/ is used to retain the same direction of a labial-coronal cluster---both are front-to-back in terms of places of articulation. There are no other dorsals in the set (i.e., no fricative, nasal or liquid dorsal), as these tend to be relatively more marked and less consistent between languages.

* We use one instance of the dorsal consonant /k/ instead of the coronal /t/ as an alternative to a labial-coronal cluster with a liquid in *C*~1~, thus retaining the same direction of a labial-coronal cluster (i.e., both labial-coronal and coronal-dorsal are front-to-back in terms of their places of articulation). We do not use other dorsals for fricative, nasal or liquid consonants, as these tend to be relatively more marked and more inconsistent between languages.

*	Lastly, we avoid sequences of obstruents that differ in voicing due to the cross-linguistic tendency of obstruent clusters to agree in voicing [see, e.g., @cho1990typology], although note that German allows /ʃv/ and /t͡sv/ clusters while banning /ʃf/.

## Audio Recordings {-}
<!-- {#sec:audio} -->
Audio stimuli for the experiment were recorded by a phonetically trained native Hebrew speaker, AA (the first author), and a phonetically trained native German speaker, HN, in a sound attenuated booth at the phonetics laboratory of the University of Cologne. Speech was recorded via head-mounted headset condenser microphone (AKG C420), capturing mono digital files at a resolution of 44.1kHz sample-rate and 24 bit depth with a Metric Halo MIO 2882 audio interface. Selected audio takes were treated in the original high resolution for DC offset correction and compression of ultra low frequencies under 52Hz (to compensate for some room reverberation effects). Audio was then downgraded from 24 to 16 bit depth with Goodhertz Good Dither dithering to be used in the perception task running on OpenSesame 3.1.9 [@mathot2012opensesame]. The audio that was submitted to analyses by the APP Detector (see Subsection \@ref(sec:obtaining)) was also downgraded in sample-rate to 16kHz. Finally all audio takes, at all resolutions, were normalized to the same RMS target of -20dBFS.

\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{/ze maʁˈgiʃ \emph{CCal} kaˈʁe.ga/} (Hebrew: ʼit feels (like) \emph{CCal} at the momentʼ) \label{ex:sentence1}
\ex \textbf{er muss \emph{CCal} kaufen} (German: ʼhe must buy \emph{CCal}ʼ) \label{ex:sentence2}
\end{exe}

To record the stimuli, the combined 87 word-like tokens were embedded within carrier sentences, appearing in a non-final position with
default declarative intonation
in order to maintain consistent prosody. Carrier sentences were also designed to minimize potential effects of resyllabification as well as co-articulation by controlling the segmental makeup immediately preceding and following target words, see examples in (\@ref(ex:sentence1)-\@ref(ex:sentence2))
(the original sentence elicitation lists are available at the OSF repository in mixed Hebrew and phonemic transcripts in the form of the slide presentations that was used in this self-paced task, see link in the opening of Section \@ref(sec:experiments)).

## Obtaining Periodic Energy Data {-}
<!-- {#sec:obtaining} -->
We extract continuous measurements of periodic energy from acoustic signals using the *APP Detector*, a computer code that was introduced in @deshmukh2003detectionsk and developed in subsequent publications [@deshmukh2005use; @vishnubhotla2007detection], with the ability to measure the spectral distribution of periodic energy from digital audio files with a 16kHz sample-rate, effectively measuring periodic energy up to 8kHz [consider that our pitch perception range is limited to periods up to approximately 4kHz, reflecting a ceiling effect of the phase-locking of neural firing rates; @wever1937perception; @attneave1971pitch; @pressnitzer2001lower; @moore2013anintro 46]. We export the periodic energy data from the APP Detector's analysis into R [@R-base], for further data manipulation, visualization, modelling, and statistics.

We sum over the different frequencies that the APP Detector measures to obtain a time series  with the sum of periodic energy over different frequencies at 10 ms intervals.
We fit a smoothed curve to the periodic energy time series, to eliminate small-scale fluctuations in the curve's trajectory, and, finally, the sum of periodic energy is log transformed, where it is divided by a value that reflects the threshold of effective voicing periodicity, thus setting a meaningful zero for the periodic energy floor (we apply Tukey's Running Median Smoothing "3RS3R" to the periodic energy data. The threshold of the log transform is calculated as the maximal value obtained for voiceless portions in the set).
<!-- [^cf-smog] -->

The periodic energy curve is fitted with Local Polynomial Regression Fitting (*loess*) in the figures. This is only used for visual clarity---all the data points and calculations are based on the periodic energy curve before this smoothing and after initial smoothing and log transform (as detailed above).

## Perception Task Details {-}
<!-- {#sec:ptask} -->

Recall that the experiments were designed as a forced-choice 2-alternative perception task, where we collected accuracy and response time information.
We determined the zero time for valid response times at the the mid point of transition from *C*~2~ to /a/, individually for each one of the 87 stimuli (given that all stimuli share the rime *al*, which is fully predictable in the context of the experiment, in contrast to the preceding material, which is unpredictable). We used manual segmentation to determine this point for each target. We then excluded response times shorter than 100ms (i.e., 100ms after the mid point of transition from *C*~2~ to /a/) as too fast to be considered as valid. This led to no exclusions from Experiment 1 and to only one observation being excluded from Experiment 2.

Participants were seated in a quiet room in front of a laptop computer (a MacBook Air 13-inch, Early 2014) running the experiment on OpenSesame 3.1.9 [@mathot2012opensesame], where they listened to the stimuli through a set of closed headphones (Sennhieser HD 201), fed directly from the laptop's internal audio interface. After verifying that participants share a standard understanding of the notion of the syllable with a few German examples of words with one and two syllables (*See*, *Spaß*, *Quark*, and *Angst* vs. *Schu-le*, *Kin-der*, *Bre-zel*, *Pflau-men*), they were instructed to listen to nonce words in an "unknown" foreign language (the use of a speaker with a Hebrew accent in the stimuli that were presented to German listeners was intended to further support a "foreign" type of perception). Participants were instructed to respond quickly and accurately on whether they hear one or two syllables by clicking '1' or '2' on the computer keyboard (participants used their left index finger to choose '1' and their right index finger to choose '2').<!-- [^cf-indexfinger]  -->
A training session of ten trials preceded the experimental trials, allowing the participants to familiarize with the task, and allowing the experimenter to adjust listening volume and monitor potential problems and misunderstandings regarding the task.

<!-- [^cf-helsinki]:  -->
Informed consent from the participants was obtained before each experimental session. The experiment complied with the June 1964 Declaration of Helsinki (carried out by the World Medical Association and entitled “Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects”), as last revised. In accordance with German Research Foundation (DFG) guidelines for experiments with unimpaired adult populations, the ethics approval is required by the Principal Investigator (in this case, Prof. Dr. Martine Grice).
